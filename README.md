# challenge-2
For this project I was tasked with creating a portfolio to demonstrate my applications to potential employers. I used placeholder links for my applications, linking them to my Github, as well as placeholder text and placeholder images until I have more deployed applications.

The acceptance criteria made it so I had to present my name, photo, links to information about me, and contact info. I chose to put these elements in the about me and nav sections. I also made sure that the "about me" text wrapped around my photo when the screen size shrunk. Satisfying another acceptance criteria, I used "a" tags with the href="#location" to ensure that when someone clicked one of the nav links that the UI scrolled to the corresponding section.

Within the work section, I included titled images corresponding to placeholder developer's applications, and used links within the images to link to a placeholder website, which I would replace with the url to a deployed application as I create more. I made sure that the first application was larger in size than the others, and moved it so the other two applications were on the same line, unless in a small screen and expanded, in which case they stack. These actions satisfied the requirments to make sure have an image that when clicked on takes the user to an application, the first application being larger than the others. a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
